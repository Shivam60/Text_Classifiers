most people bit per display typical display hardware stores 8 fewer bits per display fewer distinct colors to display computer must map image appropriate set representative this process called something would better stuck standard usage color it turns details color algorithm much impact final image quality errors introduced lowest quality since converting color image display hardware requires color this true color even feed comes thousands this happens affects pixel little two pixels started identical colors probably come slightly different each original color gets group nearby therefore always required display color regardless image the way avoid ask effect nearly meaningless talk number colors used even attempted count number distinct pixel different decoders would give different results error i occasionally see posted images described this tells poster read faq probably converted classified color like number colors useful concept on image definition already fewer definite number colors format allow palette for purposes usenet picture advantage sender color recipients this also stuck if sender different number colors resulting much poorer image quality sender use color for offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines match display full color image precisely match display able take advantage future improvements algorithms lot active research purchase better display get better view images already with stuck forevermore also worth mentioning many programs include rather shoddy if view probably getting much worse image need

what get rid deliberate information loss coefficient there still good deal information loss color free also say turn keep mind many commercial implementations cannot cope resulting even turned regular algorithm subject errors various the maximum error counts one pixel highly unlikely could perceived human might concern machine processing at regular produces files perhaps half size uncompressed true provides roughly amount guarantees if application requiring storage images less 6 bits per pixel color may want look image compression this performs better superior images 6 bits per public domain least huffman back techniques heavily covered why argument file strictly refers family compression refer specific image file the committee prevented defining file format turf wars within international

smaller huffman numbers previously cited huffman particular variant arithmetic coding specified standard subject patents owned thus cannot legally use arithmetic unless obtain licenses doctrine allows people implement test actually storing images dubious at least short i recommend people worry arithmetic space savings great enough justify potential legal in arithmetic coding used images exchanged there small chance legal situation may change stay tuned does loss accumulate repeated it would nice compressed image could decompress manipulate without image degradation beyond lost unfortunately this is not the in altered image loses though usually much lost first time the next best thing would decompress image changing get identical even current free essentially problem accumulation if repeatedly compress image eventually degrade see visible changes usually takes many cycles get visible one things list see accumulation error avoided i optimistic in could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified output original quality would introduce even simple changes cropping border could cause wondering boundaries if cropped multiples might mighty limited the bottom line useful

converting library look make sure happy throwing away corresponding give chance conversion higher quality setting some may better left explained section sixteen fewer colors convert you may find file reasonable quality check sizes experience date suggests best candidates conversion they chew storage offer potential convert least waste time converting much expect files converted small created directly to maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big files would shoot size suggested earlier many people developed odd habit putting large border around while nearly free terms storage cost it not free sharp border boundary create visible artifacts do favor crop border x windows manual automatic cropping functions painless way default q setting appropriate q settings often seem necessary avoid image apply smoothing suggested higher q setting may color photographs complex artwork usually fool eye seeing colors actually if enlarge see adjacent pixels often significantly different normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color the trouble dithering looks like color compress noise the resulting file larger lower image quality would gotten original full color image to get around want image smoothing averages together nearby thus approximating color thought saw process getting rid rapid color changes give appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high q thus reducing size compressed still obtaining output image get without with free software products based simple smoothing capability built try converting values seem work well dithering may require larger smoothing see regular patterns image even without strong smoothing definitely called too large smoothing factor blur output if image processing also smoothing separate
